### Brand Management Best Practices

- [ ] **Consistent Naming**: Use clear, consistent naming conventions
- [ ] **Asset Management**: Maintain high-quality, optimized assets
- [ ] **Configuration Validation**: Validate all brand configurations
- [ ] **Testing**: Thoroughly test each brand independently
- [ ] **Documentation**: Document brand-specific requirements
- [ ] **Team Training**: Ensure team understands new brand requirements
