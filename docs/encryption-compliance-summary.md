# App Store Encryption Compliance - Solution Summary

## Problem Identified

Your React Native/Expo app was encountering Apple's App Store encryption compliance questionnaire during submission, requiring manual intervention and potentially causing delays.

## Root Cause Analysis

The app was missing the required encryption export compliance declarations in the iOS configuration, specifically:

- Missing `ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption` key in Info.plist
- Missing Expo encryption configuration in app.json

## Solution Overview

**Compliance Category**: "None of the algorithms mentioned above"
**Justification**: App uses only standard HTTPS and React Native AsyncStorage - no proprietary encryption

## Implementation Plan Created

### 1. Documentation Created ✅

- **Comprehensive Guide**: [`docs/app-store-encryption-compliance-guide.md`](./app-store-encryption-compliance-guide.md)
- **Implementation Plan**: [`docs/encryption-compliance-implementation-plan.md`](./encryption-compliance-implementation-plan.md)

### 2. Required Code Changes Specified ✅

**iOS Info.plist** (`ios/ConstructionNews/Info.plist`):

```xml
<key>ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption</key>
<false/>
```

**Expo Configuration** (`app.json`):

```json
"ios": {
  "supportsTablet": true,
  "bundleIdentifier": "metropolis.co.uk.constructionnews",
  "config": {
    "usesNonExemptEncryption": false
  }
}
```

## Expected Benefits

1. **No Manual Intervention**: App Store Connect submissions will proceed automatically
2. **Faster Review Process**: Eliminates encryption compliance delays
3. **Consistent Builds**: All future builds will include proper declarations
4. **Multi-Brand Support**: Configuration applies to both Construction News and Nursing Times

## Next Steps Required

### Immediate Actions (Code Mode Required)

1. **Implement File Changes**: Apply the specified changes to Info.plist and app.json
2. **Test Build**: Create a test build to verify configuration
3. **Verify Submission**: Test App Store Connect submission process

### Verification Steps

1. Build the app with EAS Build
2. Check that Info.plist contains the encryption key
3. Submit to App Store Connect and verify no encryption prompts appear

## Risk Assessment

- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Breaking Changes**: None
- **Rollback**: Simple (remove added keys)
- **Testing Required**: Build verification only

## Files Modified

- ✅ `docs/app-store-encryption-compliance-guide.md` (Created)
- ✅ `docs/encryption-compliance-implementation-plan.md` (Created)
- ⏳ `ios/ConstructionNews/Info.plist` (Needs modification)
- ⏳ `app.json` (Needs modification)

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Build completes without encryption warnings
- [ ] Info.plist contains encryption compliance keys
- [ ] App Store Connect submission proceeds without manual intervention
- [ ] App functionality remains unchanged
