# Future Brand Expansion Guide

## Scaling the Multi-Brand App Store Deployment Strategy

This document outlines how the current deployment strategy can be extended to accommodate additional brands beyond Construction News and Nursing Times.

## Overview

The multi-brand architecture and deployment strategy has been designed with scalability in mind. Adding new brands follows the same established patterns while leveraging the existing infrastructure and processes.

## Scalable Architecture Benefits

### Current Foundation

The existing multi-brand system provides:

- **Centralized Codebase:** Single React Native/Expo application supporting multiple brands
- **Dynamic Configuration:** Brand-specific settings loaded from JSON configurations
- **Automated Build System:** EAS Build profiles that can be replicated for new brands
- **Asset Management:** Organized structure for brand-specific assets
- **Deployment Pipeline:** Established processes for app store submissions

### Expansion Capabilities

- **Unlimited Brands:** Architecture supports any number of brands
- **Rapid Deployment:** New brands can be added in 2-3 weeks vs. 6-8 weeks for initial setup
- **Cost Efficiency:** Shared development and maintenance costs across all brands
- **Consistent Quality:** Proven deployment processes ensure reliability

## Adding New Brands: Step-by-Step Process

### Phase 1: Brand Configuration (Week 1)

#### 1.1 Create Brand Directory Structure

```bash
# Example for new brand "Health Magazine" (hm)
mkdir brands/hm
mkdir brands/hm/assets
```

#### 1.2 Brand Configuration File

Create `brands/hm/config.json`:

```json
{
  "shortcode": "hm",
  "name": "Health Magazine",
  "displayName": "Health Magazine",
  "domain": "healthmagazine.co.uk",
  "apiConfig": {
    "baseUrl": "https://www.healthmagazine.co.uk",
    "hash": "your-api-hash",
    "menuId": 123456
  },
  "theme": {
    "colors": {
      "light": {
        "primary": "#4CAF50",
        "background": "#fff",
        "text": "#11181C",
        "icon": "#687076",
        "tabIconDefault": "#687076",
        "tabIconSelected": "#4CAF50"
      },
      "dark": {
        "primary": "#4CAF50",
        "background": "#151718",
        "text": "#ECEDEE",
        "icon": "#9BA1A6",
        "tabIconDefault": "#9BA1A6",
        "tabIconSelected": "#4CAF50"
      }
    }
  },
  "branding": {
    "logo": "./logo.svg",
    "icon": "./assets/icon.png",
    "splash": "./assets/splash.png"
  },
  "features": {
    "enablePodcasts": true,
    "enablePaper": false,
    "enableClinical": false,
    "enableEvents": true,
    "enableAsk": true
  }
}
```

#### 1.3 Register Brand

Update `brands/index.ts`:

```typescript
export const AVAILABLE_BRANDS = {
  nt: () => require("./nt/config.json"),
  cn: () => require("./cn/config.json"),
  hm: () => require("./hm/config.json"), // New brand
  // Add more brands here
} as const;
```

### Phase 2: App Store Setup (Week 1-2)

#### 2.1 Bundle Identifier Strategy

Follow the established naming convention:

- **iOS Bundle ID:** `com.emappublishing.healthmagazine`
- **Android Package:** `com.emappublishing.healthmagazine`

#### 2.2 Apple App Store Connect

- Create new app entry
- Configure bundle identifier
- Set up basic app information
- Generate certificates and provisioning profiles

#### 2.3 Google Play Console

- Create new app entry
- Configure package name
- Generate signing keys
- Set up basic app information

### Phase 3: Build Configuration (Week 2)

#### 3.1 EAS Build Profile

Add to [`eas.json`](eas.json):

```json
{
  "build": {
    "production-hm": {
      "autoIncrement": true,
      "env": {
        "EXPO_PUBLIC_BRAND": "hm"
      },
      "ios": {
        "bundleIdentifier": "com.emappublishing.healthmagazine"
      },
      "android": {
        "package": "com.emappublishing.healthmagazine"
      }
    }
  },
  "submit": {
    "production-hm": {
      "ios": {
        "appleId": "your-apple-id@emappublishing.com",
        "ascAppId": "HEALTH_MAGAZINE_ASC_APP_ID",
        "appleTeamId": "YOUR_APPLE_TEAM_ID"
      },
      "android": {
        "serviceAccountKeyPath": "./google-play-service-account.json",
        "track": "production"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### 3.2 Brand-Specific App Configuration

Create `app.hm.json`:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "Health Magazine",
    "slug": "health-magazine",
    "ios": {
      "bundleIdentifier": "com.emappublishing.healthmagazine"
    },
    "android": {
      "package": "com.emappublishing.healthmagazine"
    }
    // ... other brand-specific configurations
  }
}
```

#### 3.3 Build Scripts

Add to [`package.json`](package.json):

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build:hm:prod": "EXPO_PUBLIC_BRAND=hm eas build --platform all --profile production-hm",
    "submit:hm": "eas submit --platform all --profile production-hm"
  }
}
```

### Phase 4: Asset Creation and Deployment (Week 2-3)

#### 4.1 Asset Creation

- Design brand-specific icons and graphics
- Create screenshots using brand colors and content
- Write app descriptions and metadata
- Follow established asset organization structure

#### 4.2 Testing and Deployment

- Test brand-specific functionality
- Verify API integrations
- Submit to app stores
- Monitor review process

---

## Scalability Considerations

### Technical Scalability

#### Build System Optimization

```typescript
// Automated brand configuration generation
interface BrandConfig {
  shortcode: string;
  name: string;
  bundleId: string;
  packageName: string;
  colors: ThemeColors;
}

const generateEASProfile = (brand: BrandConfig) => ({
  [`production-${brand.shortcode}`]: {
    autoIncrement: true,
    env: { EXPO_PUBLIC_BRAND: brand.shortcode },
    ios: { bundleIdentifier: brand.bundleId },
    android: { package: brand.packageName },
  },
});
```

#### Asset Management Automation

```bash
# Script to generate asset directories for new brands
#!/bin/bash
BRAND_CODE=$1
BRAND_NAME=$2

mkdir -p "brands/${BRAND_CODE}/assets"
mkdir -p "assets/${BRAND_NAME}/app-store/icons"
mkdir -p "assets/${BRAND_NAME}/app-store/screenshots"
mkdir -p "assets/${BRAND_NAME}/play-store"

echo "Created asset structure for ${BRAND_NAME} (${BRAND_CODE})"
```

### Operational Scalability

#### Team Structure for Multiple Brands

- **Brand Manager:** Oversees 2-3 brands
- **Shared Development Team:** Maintains core codebase
- **Brand-Specific Designers:** Create assets for assigned brands
- **QA Team:** Tests across all brands systematically

#### Deployment Pipeline Optimization

```yaml
# CI/CD Pipeline for Multiple Brands
stages:
  - test
  - build-all-brands
  - deploy-staging
  - deploy-production

build-all-brands:
  parallel:
    - build-construction-news
    - build-nursing-times
    - build-health-magazine
    # Add new brands here
```

## Cost Analysis for Brand Expansion

### Per-Brand Costs

#### Initial Setup (New Brand)

- **Development Time:** 2-3 weeks (vs. 6-8 for first brands)
- **Design and Assets:** £1,500-£3,000
- **Testing and QA:** £500-£1,500
- **App Store Setup:** £200-£500
- **Total per New Brand:** £2,200-£5,000

#### Ongoing Maintenance (Per Brand/Year)

## Brand Portfolio Management

### Recommended Brand Limits

- **Large Team (10+ developers):** 10+ brands possible

### Brand Performance Monitoring

```typescript
interface BrandMetrics {
  brandCode: string;
  downloads: number;
  activeUsers: number;
  rating: number;
  revenue: number;
  maintenanceCost: number;
  roi: number;
}

class BrandPortfolioManager {
  async evaluateBrandPerformance(): Promise<BrandMetrics[]> {
    const brands = await this.getAllBrands();
    return brands.map((brand) => ({
      brandCode: brand.shortcode,
      downloads: this.getDownloads(brand),
      activeUsers: this.getActiveUsers(brand),
      rating: this.getAppStoreRating(brand),
      revenue: this.getRevenue(brand),
      maintenanceCost: this.getMaintenanceCost(brand),
      roi: this.calculateROI(brand),
    }));
  }
}
```
